# multi-agent-langgraph

A skeleton for multi-agent development using LangGraph.

## Backend Architecture

### Tech Stack:
- **Python** (recommended for LangGraph integration)
- **FastAPI** or **Flask** (for RESTful API)
- **LangGraph** (for multi-agent orchestration)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT or OAuth2

### Components:

#### API Layer:
- Exposes RESTful endpoints for agent management, task submission, and result retrieval.
- Handles authentication and authorization.

#### Agent Manager:
- Manages lifecycle and orchestration of multiple agents using LangGraph.
- Handles agent registration, communication, and state management.

#### Task Queue:
- Manages incoming tasks and distributes them to agents.
- Can use Celery, Redis Queue, or similar.

#### Database Layer:
- Stores user data, agent configurations, task history, and results.

#### Integration Layer:
- Interfaces with external APIs or services as required by agents.

### Deployment:
- Containerized using Docker.
- Deployable on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) or on-premises.

## Frontend Architecture (Next.js)

### Tech Stack:
- **Next.js** (React framework)
- **TypeScript** (recommended)
- **Tailwind CSS** or **Chakra UI** (for styling)
- **Axios** or **Fetch API** (for backend communication)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js or custom JWT

### Components:

#### Pages & Routing:
- Uses Next.js file-based routing for main pages: Dashboard, Agent Management, Task Submission, Results.

#### State Management:
- React Context API or Zustand for global state (user, agents, tasks).

#### API Integration:
- Service layer for communicating with backend REST API.

#### UI Components:
- Modular components for agents, tasks, results, and user profile.

#### Authentication:
- Handles login, registration, and session management.

### Deployment:
- Static export or server-side rendering as needed.
- Deployable on Vercel, Netlify, or any Node.js-compatible server.
